üõ°Ô∏è Network Security: Malicious URL Prediction MLOps Pipeline

End-to-End ETL and ML Deployment for Cybersecurity Threat Detection

This project establishes a comprehensive MLOps pipeline for predicting malicious URLs based on various network security features. It showcases an in-depth ETL process, robust modular coding with OOP, advanced experiment tracking, and automated deployment of a FastAPI-based inference service.
üéØ Project Overview

In the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, identifying malicious URLs is paramount for protecting users and systems. This project addresses this critical need by developing a machine learning model capable of classifying URLs as benign or malicious based on their characteristics.

Key Objectives:

    Develop a robust classification model: Accurately identify malicious URLs.

    Implement a comprehensive ETL pipeline: Automate data extraction, validation, and transformation.

    Ensure modularity and reusability: Design the codebase with OOP principles and clear separation of concerns.

    Achieve reproducibility: Track experiments and manage artifacts effectively.

    Automate deployment: Deliver the model as a scalable API service.

    Secure operations: Manage sensitive credentials and permissions for cloud resources.

üöß Challenges & Solutions

Developing this complex ETL and MLOps pipeline presented several interesting challenges, which were successfully overcome:

    Complex ETL Logic: Handling diverse network security features and ensuring robust data validation and transformation required in-depth ETL concepts and careful implementation. This was addressed by designing a modular ETL pipeline with dedicated stages for each process and implementing custom validation rules.

    MongoDB Atlas Integration: Seamlessly integrating with MongoDB Atlas for data ingestion and ensuring efficient data retrieval was a key challenge. This was solved by utilizing appropriate MongoDB drivers and optimizing queries for performance.

    Secure Credential Management: Securely managing MongoDB Atlas connection strings, GCP service account keys, and other sensitive information was critical. This was addressed by using environment variables and secure configuration practices, avoiding hardcoded credentials.

    Reproducibility with Dagshub: Integrating Dagshub for comprehensive experiment tracking and data versioning to ensure full reproducibility across different runs and environments.

    Cloud Run Deployment Failures: Initial deployments to Google Cloud Run consistently failed due to container crashes. This was traced to several issues:

        Missing Environment Variables: Critical environment variables (like MONGODB_URL_KEY) were not being passed to the container. This was resolved by using the --set-env-vars flag in the gcloud run deploy command.

        Invalid Docker Base Image: The Dockerfile specified a non-existent Python base image (python:3.12-slim-buster). This was corrected to a valid tag (python:3.12-slim-bookworm).

        Incorrect Docker CMD Formatting: The CMD instruction in the Dockerfile used the "exec form," preventing environment variable substitution. Switching to the "shell form" (CMD gunicorn ...) allowed the $PORT variable to be correctly interpreted.

        Blocking Code on Import: The most elusive issue was a dagshub.init() call running in the main body of model_trainer.py. This line was making a blocking network call during module import, causing the container to hang on startup. The final resolution involved moving this call into the __init__ method of the relevant class, ensuring it only executed when explicitly needed.

    GCP Permissions & Service Accounts: Configuring the precise IAM roles and permissions for GCP service accounts to interact with GCR and other GCP services required meticulous attention to the principle of least privilege.

üîÆ Future Enhancements

    Real-time Data Ingestion: Implement streaming data ingestion (e.g., using Kafka or Pub/Sub) for real-time threat detection.

    Automated Retraining: Set up scheduled jobs to periodically retrain the model with new data from MongoDB Atlas.

    Model Monitoring: Implement dedicated services to monitor model performance in production, detect data drift, and trigger alerts.

    Scalability & Resilience: Explore deploying the FastAPI service on Kubernetes (GKE) for advanced orchestration, auto-scaling, and self-healing capabilities.

    Feature Store: Implement a feature store to manage and serve features consistently for both training and inference.
